# Data Scientist - Code Challenge

We need to predict the demand for the next 24 hours by utilizing past electricity demand data points, humidity, temperature, dew point, and other drivers like weekdays, holidays, and etc. 

#### Inputs: 

- sample data.csv is attached. 


### Output: 

A 24-hour demand forecast for a sample day in July or August. 

  
## General Requirements
- The data set may contain outliers and abnormal values.
- This is everything you need to know about having a better development experience. 
- Write an instruction to run the project.
- Donâ€™t commit the .vscode or .idea directory.

### Evaluation:

- The work will be evaluated based on the accuracy of the electricity demand forecast, the clarity of the code and documentation, and the overall effectiveness of the solution.
- The acceptable error rate must be less than 5% (AE < 500 MW, or accuracy more than 95%)
  
### Deliverables for the Code Challenge

- Detailed Report: Provide a comprehensive report covering model selection, fine-tuning processes, evaluation metrics, and results.
- Code and Documentation: Include all code and documentation necessary to reproduce the experiments and results.

### Submission
- Please submit a GitHub link with your work and fork the repository for collaboration.
- You have 1 week to send the challenge!
